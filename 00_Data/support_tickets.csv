I understand that it is possible to access to my own data on Strava with API.
I’m datascientist and my goal is to analyse my own cycling and running records within Python

I don’t want to create any applications or any website, I just want to analyse my race for my personal knowledge.

Is it possible  to get my data in this case ? If yes, how should I register to cet the token ?

I contact developers@strava.com<mailto:developers@strava.com> as you can see, they give your adress for further assistance.

Thanks in advance for your answer

Thierry
